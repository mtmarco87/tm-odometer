TmOdometer (Decimal Fixed)
========================
### Powered by: Marco Trinastich [GitHub](https://github.com/mtmarco87/odometer)

Odometer is an awesome Javascript and CSS library for smoothly transitioning numbers originally made by Adam Schwartz and Zack Bloom ([HubSpot](http://github.hubspot.com/odometer/docs/welcome)).

### NOTE: 
In this version I have implemented an useful fix, the decimal precision passed in input to the component
is now preserved during and after the animation, thus making visible also the zeroes at the end of an integer
number (e.g. with a precision of 2, 1200 will be displayed as 1200.00)

## Angular 9 version

I have created also an Angular 9 version of this library. If you need it check this link:  [TmNgOdometer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tm-ng-odometer)
